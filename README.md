# CodeRED Hackathon Interface

The interface is a simple, easy to use web app for the organizers of the [CodeRED Hackathon](http://codered.cougarcs.com/). It is built using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), It gives us quick access to the attendee database, along with quick access to our documents. It uses [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) as the backend to store the data.


## Installation

You can also install all the dependencies automatically via npm and Bower:

```bash
$ npm install
```

```bash
$ bower install
```

Once you've included AngularFire and its dependencies into your project, you will have access to
the Hackathon Interface.

## Usage

By default there are no links that take you to the `Registration` or `Login` screen, those must be added to the url in order to access them. `Registration` will be removed in the near future so that non-organizers can not register.
